Instructions on running "My Photos Angular Client" from Windows/Linux/Mac
=========================================================================

This code has been tested with
- Node 20.14.0
- NPM 10.4.0
- Angular 17.2

Steps:

1. Install latest Node.js (Angular needs Node.js)

    https://nodejs.org/en/

    Make sure that the Node Package Manager is automatically installed by checking

    npm -v

2. From directory "myalbum", run the following command
   to install all node module dependencies.

    npm install


3. Open the file src/app/myphotos.model.ts and uncomment the appropriate settings
   depending on which Authorization Server you want to use. (Google or Okta). Make
   sure you have the client registered with the Authorization Server and enter that 
   client ID.

4. If you are running the Okta Setup, then you would have to start the "My Photos
   Resource Server" at port 8081. Look at the instructions in lecture "Okta Coding project :
   Spring Boot 'My Photos Client'" local setup on how to do that. For this, you just need to
   run the resource server and not the client

5. To run the Web server with Angular Client installed at port 4200, run the following command
   from the root of the Angular application.

    ng serve

6. Access the "My Photos Angular Client" from a browser.

    http://localhost:4200/
